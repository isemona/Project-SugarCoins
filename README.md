Inspired by Mint and Cryptocurrency. 
SugarCoin is a gamified Flask web application with user authenticated API that tracks and budgets sugar consumption. 
Using D3 visualization, this app will pinpoint any sweet-tooth dependency factors. 
And since added sugar directly affects weight and glucose levels, the app will monitor these data points using Charts.js. 
Lastly, a text reminder is integrated through Twilio API called - SugarWallet - which reports the user's current balance.
